## 🛡️ Trappers: A Unified AI Phishing Defense Ecosystem
![alt text](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg) ![alt text](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-success.svg)


Trappers is a multi-layered, AI-powered ecosystem designed to proactively detect and neutralize phishing and scam attempts across all your digital touchpoints—from your web browser to your home network.
The Problem
Phishing is no longer just about suspicious emails. Attackers now leverage AI to create sophisticated, context-aware scams delivered via SMS, social media, and malicious websites. Traditional, signature-based security tools are failing because they are too slow and rigid to combat these dynamic, zero-day threats. A fragmented defense is no defense at all.
Our Solution: The Trapper Ecosystem
Trappers provides a holistic, unified defense by deploying specialized "traps" at every vulnerable point of your digital life. All traps are powered by our central Trapper AI Core, a deep learning engine that analyzes threats in real-time and shares intelligence across the entire ecosystem.
The Trapper Components
Our ecosystem consists of four specialized security layers:
1. WebTrapper (Browser Extension)
Status: Working Prototype ✅
Description: The first line of defense, living directly in your web browser. WebTrapper analyzes URLs, webpage content, and website structure in real-time to block phishing sites and brand impersonation attacks before they can load. It's fast, lightweight, and provides instant user alerts.
2. PocketTrapper (Mobile Security)
Status: Concept 💡
Description: A mobile application for Android and iOS designed to protect you on the go. PocketTrapper will scan incoming SMS messages and emails for malicious links and scam language, blocking smishing (SMS phishing) and mobile-based email attacks at the source.
3. PowerTrapper (Network Security)
Status: Concept 💡
Description: A lightweight software agent for your home or small business router. PowerTrapper operates at the network level, using DNS filtering and packet inspection to block connections to known malicious servers and phishing infrastructures for every device on your network, including IoT devices.
4. TowerTrapper (Carrier-Level Defense)
Status: Future Vision 🚀
Description: The ultimate layer of protection. TowerTrapper is a proposed carrier-grade solution designed to be deployed on telecommunication network towers. It would filter phishing and scam SMS messages at the network level, before they are ever delivered to a user's phone, protecting millions of users simultaneously.
How It Works: The Trapper AI Core
All Trapper components are clients of our powerful, centralized AI backend.

A Trapper client (e.g., WebTrapper) encounters a potential threat.
It sends the relevant data (URL, text snippets) to our Secure API Gateway.
The Trapper AI Core analyzes the data using a hybrid of models:
A fast LightGBM model for lexical and URL feature analysis.
A fine-tuned BERT model for deep semantic and contextual understanding.
This verdict is cross-referenced with our Threat Intelligence Database, which is continuously updated from sources like OpenPhish.
A verdict is returned in under 100ms, and the endpoint client takes action (e.g., blocking the website).

Getting Started: WebTrapper Demo
You can test the working prototype of WebTrapper right now.
Clone the repository:
code
Bash
git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/trappers.git
Navigate to the WebTrapper directory:
code
Bash
cd trappers/webtrapper
Load the extension in your browser:
Chrome/Edge: Go to chrome://extensions/, enable "Developer mode", and click "Load unpacked", then select the webtrapper folder.
Firefox: Go to about:debugging, click "This Firefox", click "Load Temporary Add-on", and select the manifest.json file inside the webtrapper folder.
Usage: The extension will now be active. Navigate to any website, and the extension icon will indicate its safety status. Try a known safe site and a link from a phishing feed to see it in action!
Roadmap
Our vision for Trappers is ambitious. Here's our plan:

Q3 2025: Develop WebTrapper prototype and core AI backend.

Q4 2025: Refine WebTrapper, add user feedback mechanisms, and package for official web stores.

Q1 2026: Begin development of PocketTrapper for Android.

Q2 2026: Research and design the architecture for PowerTrapper.

Future: Explore partnerships to bring the TowerTrapper vision to life.
